You can also customize the "brand" part of the navbar which appears on the left and is not collapsed on any device.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout, and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like.
Like for navbar links, this organisation makes it easy to mix and match pkgdown defaults with your own customisations.
The components are pasted together.

This is the default structure:

``` yaml
navbar:
  brand:
    structure:  [package, version]
```

To add a new component to the navbar brand, you need to modify both `brand.structure` and `brand.components`.
For example, the following yaml adds a dog image [from Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/photo/husky-siberien-noir-et-blanc-4681107/) left to the package name.

``` yaml
navbar:
  brand:
    structure: [dog, package, version]
    components:
      dog: '<img alt="husky" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4681107/pexels-photo-4681107.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940" style="width:30px;"></img>'
```
